Aim: teach and inspire to learn basic programming;

What: interesting, user-friendly game

How: Unity + C#

General description: game, where movements of a player are controlled by dragging and dropping specific blocks, representing pieces of of code, e.g. "goforward" function


Must:

See the map split into cells(fields)
Some cell inaccessible (obstacles) 
Compose code from drag and drop blocks
Characters behaviour determined by the code blocks
Press "Run" button to run code
Combine "walk", "turn", "if", "while" 
Complete levels by reaching a point
Decide on platform (simplest one)

Should:

Add "if else" "do while"
 Have fancy graphics
Be able to save game progress
Display C code + some explanation
Hint/model answer if stuck
"Jump", "Attack" functions  Could:

Add "compile" feature 
Syntax for ifs (determine conditions) 
Support different languages: Java, C#…
Several points to reach - rating of how well performed
Several textures for the environment/player
When the user steps on certain specific cells, some things would happen in the environment 
 Won't:

Shouldn't be too complex in terms of programming
Shouldn't be based on one language
